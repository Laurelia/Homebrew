# Perception 
___
Perception measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your Senses.

### Perception Checks
A Perception check can model any attempt to spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. 

### Attack Rolls and Damage
You add your Perception modifier to your Attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a Longbow or Blowgun. You can also add your Perception modifier to your Attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the Precise property, such as a Dagger or a Rapier.

### Passive Perception.
When a creature hides, there’s a chance you will notice it even if you aren’t searching. 
To determine whether you notice such a creature, the GM compares the creatures Dexterity (Stealth) check with your Passive Perception score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Perception modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5.

### Reflex Saving Throws
Sometimes, you will have to make a reflex saving throw to avoid attacks, area of effect spells, and forced movement. Use the average of your Dexterity and Perception for your Reflex saving throw.

### Wisdom (Perception Checks)
Pre existing Wisdom (Perception) Checks are treated as Perception Checks. Any Race, Feat, or Item that gives a character proficiency in Wisdom (Perception) Checks will instead give proficiency in Perception Saving Throws. The Ranger and Rogue are Proficient in Perception
